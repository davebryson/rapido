Rapido is intended for permissioned use without a coin.

- Need to establish ID and user's should have DID's for other use

Flow:
- Genesis has a set of trust anchors (TA) that can create accounts for others
- New User asks TA for account 
- User proves ownership of DID to TA and TA confirms authorization to add User (out of band)
- On approval, TA issues account to user by sending a signed Tx to Rapido with the user's base DID
- Rapido, verified TA signature and checks validity of new DID 
- Rapido creates account for user 


Account: is the base.  A user maintains a master key for signing transactions
Account id is the did
Did: generic DID verifiable data store

NOTE: TA's can create sybil attacks!.  They can create as many accounts as they want!


TA tx msg format.  Note it includes the pubkey (master) for the DidAccount key
Create DID Tx:
{
    sender: TA 
    payload: {
        doc: diddoc,
        master: pubkey 
    }
    signature: TA
}

How to determine Tx signature public key to use for user? 

Did: 
{
    id: 1234
    publicKey: [
        {
            id: "#rapido"
            publicKeyHex: ""
        }
    ]
    
}

If a signed tx included a key id.  Rapido can look up the pub key from the Did?
